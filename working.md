**Justice-Level Heterogeneity in Certiorari Voting: The U.S. Supreme Court, October Terms 1939, 1968, 1982 (with Gregory Caldeira)**

Though the literature on agenda-setting at the U.S. Supreme Court is sizable, justice-vote-level multivariate analyses of certiorari are almost exclusively limited to samples of discussed cases from 1986-1993.  Moreover, these studies have done very little to explore justice-level heterogeneity on certiorari.  Here, we present an initial effort to address these lacunae by analyzing the predictors of individual justices' cert votes on all paid dockets from the 1939, 1968, and 1982 terms. We find substantial justice-level heterogeneity in the weight that justices place on the standard factors shaping the cert vote.  We also show that some of this heterogeneity is associated with justice experience and ideological extremism, largely in theoretically predicted ways.  In closing, we sound a note of caution on drawing conclusions about effects of justice attributes, when the number of justices is relatively small.

**Aesthetic Preferences and Policy Preferences as Determinants of U.S. Supreme Court Writing Style (with Jeff Budziak)**

Recent literature on writing style in U.S. Supreme Court opinions has focused on style as a means of furthering justices’ policy goals. In particular, an opinion’s clarity is proposed to make the implementation of the announced policy more likely. We give a formal argument that the observed distribution of opinion clarity is not easily reconcilable with justices who are striving to write clearly in service of policy implementation related goals; this is true even if there are case-level costs that sometimes make writing clearly more difficult. We propose that justices having aesthetic preferences (essentially, stylistic preferences over opinion language that are unrelated to policy implementation) that they weight heavily could explain the observed distribution of opinion clarity. Our analysis of some 4500 majority opinions 1955–2008 is largely consistent with our theoretical argument.

**Effect Sizes for Calculation of Second Differences After Logistic and Probit Regression: Alternative Quantities of Interest**

Social scientists are often interested in how the effect of some covariate on an outcome varies across groups. A common approach is to calculate a second difference, the difference between two group-specific effect sizes. I propose four alternative quantities of interest for calculating second differences after estimation of logistic or probit regression. While the conventional approach is based on setting covariate values that are constant
across groups, the alternatives seek to compare effects that are more directly comparable across groups, in two specific senses. The approaches allow different substantive questions to be addressed and reduce dependence on the nonlinear functional form of logit and probit. I compare the proposed alternatives with the conventional approach in an application testing whether effects of election day registration on turnout are conditional on education, showing that the method chosen to calculate second differences can substantially affect the inferences drawn.

**Agenda Control in the Hughes Court, October Term 1939 (with Gregory Caldeira)**

We examine the composition of the set of cases discussed and the U.S. Supreme Court's collective decisions on writs of certiorari through an analysis of all paid petitions voted on in OT 1939.

**Innocuous Time-saver or Counter-majoritarian Loophole? The Cert Pool and Policy on the U.S. Supreme Court**

Since 1972, the certiorari petitions that arrive at the Supreme Court are randomly assigned for review to one of the five to eight justices who are members of the Supreme Court cert pool. Justices who are not members of the pool still review each petition. Thus, some petitions for review are evaluated by as few as two justices (or their clerks), and the rest of the Court relies on the recommendations of these justices. This practice has been criticized for its potentially counter-majoritarian implications. Formalizing the communication between the better-informed justices who review a petition and the rest of the Court as a sender-receiver game, I assess the circumstances under which the Court median's preferred policy outcome is subverted. Then, I analyze the decision to opt out of the cert pool. In some equilibria, the cert pool can move policy away from the median justice; in others (specifically, those in which one justice on each side of the median opts out of the cert pool) it is predicted to have no influence. Empirical patterns of cert pool membership in the last eleven natural courts are consistent with equilibrium predictions.

**Testing Theories of Strategic Decision-Making on the U.S. Supreme Court (dissertation)**

The dissertation addresses competing theories of influence on the U.S. Supreme Court. In essence, the competing theoretical models differ over the location of Supreme Court policy. The Court median model proposes that the median justice sets policy; the agenda-setter model suggests that assignment of the majority opinion is an agenda-setting power that can draw policy away from the Court median; the majority median model indicates that Court policy reflects the median member of the majority coalition. All three models have theoretically compelling elements; however, there have been few systematic assessments of their empirical relevance, most of these have been limited to the final opinion-writing stage, and the evidence on their relative explanatory power is mixed. I analyze these three formal models of Court policy-making, and derive predictions that each makes for four stages of Court decision-making. Then, I test the predictions at the three non-final stages, using archival and original data for the Court terms 1946-1985. I find conditional support for the Court median and agenda-setter models.
